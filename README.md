**Motivation**

The original motivation for this project is to make it for iOS or Android tablets since there are no real good note-taking applications for these platforms.

**Features**

The application has intuitive features that enhances the user's experience while taking notes for a class, during a meeting, etc. These features are designed to assist the user without being intrusive or disruptive of workflow.
